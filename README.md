On csc411(consumer&producer) run the code to get each student information produced by the producer and consumed by the consumer for displaying the results using Jupyter Notebook.(first open microsoft edge and then open Jupyter then go back to microsoft edge where Jupyter will launch itself on edge the choose the folder where the files are saved then click the file you want to open the run).
On the Socket 2 file do the same opening steps as file csc411((consumer&producer). The code will run outputing what the producer has produced and the consumer consuming what the producer has produced.
PLEASE IGNORE THE Untitled10.ipynb file.
